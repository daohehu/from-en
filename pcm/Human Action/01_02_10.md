### The Procedure of Economics

De scope of praxeology na de explication of de category of human action. All wey dey needed for de deduction of all praxeological theorems na knowledge of de essence of human action.  Na knowledge wey dey  our own because we be men; no being of human descent wey pathological conditions  to reduced to a merely vegetative existence lacks am. No special experience dey needed in order to comprehend dese theorems, and no experience, however rich, could disclose dem to a being who no know a priori waitin human action be. De only way to a cognition of dese theorems na logical analysis of our inherent knowledge of de category of action. We must deythink ourselves and reflect upon de structure of human action. Like logic and mathematics, praxeological knowledge say e dey in us; e no dey come from without.

All de concepts and theorems of praxeology dey implied for de category of human action. De first task na to extract and to deduce dem, to expound dia implications and to define de universal conditions of acting as such. Having shown waitin de conditions dey required by any action, one must go forda and define--of course, or a categorial and formal sense--de less general conditions required for special modes of acting. E go dey possible to deal wit dis second task by delineating all de thinkable conditions and deducing from dem all inferences logically permissible. Such an all-comprehensive system would provide a theory referring not only to human action as e dey under de conditions and circumstances given for de real world iwey man dey lives and acts. E go deal no less wit hypothetical acting dis kind go take place under de unrealizable conditions of imaginary worlds.

But de end of science na to know reality. E no dey  mental gymnastics or a logical pastime. Diafore praxeology restricts im inquiries to de study of acting under those conditions and presuppositions which dem give for reality. Im studies acting under unrealized and unrealizable conditions only from two points of view. E deals wit states of affairs which, although no dey real in de present and past world, fit possibly become real at some future date. And e examines unreal and unrealizable conditions if dis kind inquiry dey needed for a satisfactory grasp of waitin dey go on under de conditions present for reality.

Howeva, dis reference to experience no impair de aprioristic character of praxeology and economics. Experience dey merely directs our curiosity to certain problems and diverts am from oda problems. Im tells us waitin we go explore, but e no tell us how we fit proceed in our search for knowledge. Moreova, e no dey experience but thinkin alone which teaches us say, and waitin instances, e dey necessary to investigate unrealizable hypothetical conditions in order to conceive waiting dey happen for de real world.

De disutility of labor no dey categorial and aprioristic character. We fit without contradiction think of a world in which labor no dey cause uneasiness, and we fit depict de state of affairs prevailing for such a world.[^23] But de real world dey conditioned by de disutility of labor. Only theorems based on de assumption say labor na source of uneasiness wey dey applicable for de comprehension of waitin dey happen for dis world.

Experience teaches say dere is disutility of labor. But e no teach am directly. No phenomenon way introduces imself as disutility of labor. Dere are only data of experience way dey interpreted, on de ground of aprioristic knowledge, to mean say men consider leisure--i.e., de absence of labor--oda thins dey equal, as more desirable condition dan de expenditure of labor. We see say men renounce advantages wey dem fit get by working more--dat is, say dem been ready to make sacrifices for de attainment of leisure. We infer from dis fact say leisure na valued as a good and say labor dey regarded as a burden. But for previous praxeological insight, we no go ever be for de position to reach dis conclusion.

A theory of indirect exchange and all forda theories built upon am--as de theory of circulation credit--dey applicable only to de interpretation of events within a world for which indirect exchange dey practiced. In a world of barter trade only am go be mere intellectual play. E dey unlikely say de economists of dis kind world, if economic science fit get emerged at all for am, e go give any thought to de problems of indirect exchange, money, and all de rest. In our actual world, however, dis kind studies dey essential part of de economic theory.

De fact say praxeology, for fixing im eye on de comprehension of reality, concentrates upon de investigation of those problems wey dey useful for dis, no alter de aprioristic character of im reasoning. But im marks de way in which economics, up to now de only elaborated part of praxeology, presents de results of im endeavors.

Economics no dey follow de procedure of logic and mathematics. E no present de integrated system of pure aprioristic ratiocination severed from any reference to reality. For introducing assumptions into  reasoning, im satisfies imself sayde treatment of the assumptions concerned fit render useful services for de comprehension of reality. Im no strictly separate for im treatises and monographs pure science from de application of im theorems to de solution of concrete historical and political problems. Im adopts for de organized presentation of im results a form in which aprioristic theory and de interpretation of historical phenomena are intertwined.

E dey obvious say dis mode of procedure dey enjoined upon economics by de very nature and essence of itm subject matter. Im done give proof of im expediency. Howevea, one must not overlook de fact say de manipulation of dis singular and logically somewat strange procedure requires caution and subtlety, and say uncritical and superficial minds ger again and again been led astray by careless confusion of de two epistemologically different methods implied.

No such thins dey as a historical method of economics or a discipline of institutional economics. Economics dey and  economic history dey. De two must neva be confused. All theorems of economics dey necessarily valid for every instance for which all de assumptions presupposed dey given. Of course, dem no get practical significance for situations wey dese conditions no it present. De theorems referring to indirect exchange no dey applicable to conditions where there  no indirectly exchange. But dis does not impair dia validity.[^24]

De issue done dey obfuscated by de endeavors of governments and powerful pressure groups to disparage economics and to defame de economists. Despots and democratic majorities are drunk wit power. Dem must reluctantly admit dem de be subject to de laws of nature. But dem reject de very notion of economic law. No be dem be de supreme legislators? No be dem get de power to crush every opponent? No war lord dey prone to acknowledge any limits oda dan those dem imposed on him by a superior armed force. Servile scribblers dey always ready to foster dis kind complacency by expounding de appropriate doctrines. Dem call dia garbled presumptions "historical economics." In fact, economic history na long record of government policies wey failed because dem be designed a with a bold disregard for de laws of economics.

E dey impossible to understand de history of economic think say if person  no pay attention to de fact say economics like dis dey challenging to dey conceit of those wey dey in power. An economist fit never be a favorite of autocrats and demagogues. Wit dem he dey  always de mischief-maker, and de more dem dey inwardly convinced say im objections dey well founded, de more dem hate am.

For de face of all dis frenzied agitation e dey expedient to establish de fact say de starting point of all praxeological and economic reasoning, de category of human action, dey proof against any criticisms and objections. No appeal to any historical or empirical considerations whateva fit discover any fault for de proposition wey men purposefully aim at certain chosen ends. No talk about irrationality, de unfathomable depths of de human soul, de spontaneity of de phenomena of life, automatisms, reflexes, and tropisms, invalidate fit de statement say man makes use of im reason for de realization of wishes and desires. From de unshakable foundation of de category of human action praxeology and economics dey proceed step by step by means of discursive reasoning. Precisely defining assumptions and conditions, dem construct a system of concepts and draw all de inferences implied by logically unassailable ratiocination. Wit regard to de results thus obtained only two attitudes dey possible; either one fit unmask logical errors for de chain of de deductions wey produced these results, or one must acknowledge dia correctness and validity.

E dey vain to object say life and reality no dey logical. Life and reality dey neither logical nor illogical; dem simply give. But logic na de only tool available to man for ce comprehension of both. E dey vain to object say life and history dey inscrutable and ineffable and say human reason fit never penetrate to dia inner core. De critics contradict demselves in uttering words about de ineffable and expounding theories--of course, spurious theories--about de unfathomable. Plenty thins dey beyond de reach of de human mind. But as far as man dey able to attain any knowledge, howeva limited, he fit use only one avenue of approach, wey opened by reason.

No less illusory be de endeavors to play off understanding against de theorems of economics. de domain of historical understanding dey exclusively de elucidation of those problems wey no fit be entirely elucidated by de nonhistorical sciences. Understanding must never contradict de theories developed by de nonhistorical sciences. Understanding fit never do anything but, on de one hand, establish de fact say people dey motivated by certain ideas, aimed at certain ends, and applied certain means for de attainment of these ends, and, on de oda hand, assign to de various historical factors dia relevance so far as dis no fit be achieved by de nonhistorical sciences. Understanding does no entitle de modern historian to assert wey exorcism ever be an appropriate means to cure sick cows. Neither im permit am to maintain say an economic law been no valid for ancient Rome or in de empire of de Incas.

Man no dey infallible. Im searche for truth--dat is, for de most adequate comprehension of reality as far as de structure of im mind and reason make am accessible to im. Man fit neva become omniscient. Im no fit neva be absolutely certain say im inquiries no dey misled and say waitin im, considers as certain truth no be error. All dat man fit do na to submit all im theories again and again to de most critical reexamination. Dis means for de economist to trace back all theorems to dia unquestionable and certain ultimate basis, de category of human action, and to test by de most careful scrutiny all assumptions and inferences leading from dis basis to de theorem under examination. E no fit be contended say dis procedure dey a guarantee against error. But e dey undoubtedly de most effective method of avoiding error.

Praxeology--and consequently economics too—e dey deductive system. E draw im strength from de starting point of im deductions, from de category of action. No economic theorem fit be considered sound say e no solidly fastened upon dis foundation by an irrefutable chain of reasoning. A statement proclaimed without dis kind connection dey arbitrary and floats for midair. E dey impossible to deal wit a special segment of economics if person no encase am for a complete system of action.

De empirical sciences start from singular events and proceed from de unique and individual to de more universal. Dia treatment na subject to specialization. Dem fit deal wit segments without paying attention to de whole field. De economist must neva be a specialist. For dealing wit any problem e must always fix im glance upon de whole system.

Historians often sin for dis respect. Dem be ready to invent theorems ad hoc. Dem sometimes fail to recognize say e dey impossible to abstract any causal relations from de study of complex phenomena. Dia pretension to investigate reality without any reference to waiting dem disparage as preconceived ideas dey vain. In fact dem unwittingly apply popular doctrines long since unmasked as fallacious and contradictory.
