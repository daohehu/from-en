### Ends and Means

De result make come sought by an action na called its end. Goal, or aim. One come use dis teams for an ordinary talk also to signify intermediate ends, goals, or aims; dese na points which man way dey act wants come reach only becos he come believes dat he go reach his ultimate end, goal or aim in passing beyond dem. Strictly talking de end, goal, or aim of any action na always de relief from a felt uneasiness.

A means na warin serves to de attainment of any end, goal, or aim. Means na not in de given universe; inside dis universe dere come exist only things. A things come becomes a means when human go come reason plans to employ it for de attainment of some end and human action really employs it for dis reason. As man dey think sees de serviceableness of things, i.e., dire ability to come dey minister to his own  ends, and acting man come dem makes dem means. Na of primary importance to come realize dat parts of de external world come become means only through de operation of de human being mind and its offshoot, human being action. Outside object na as such only phenomena of de physical universe and de subject matter of de natural sciences. Na human being meaning and action which dey transfotm dem into means. Praxeology nor fit come deal with de outside world, but with man’s conduct way dey regard to am.  Praxeological reality na not de physical universe, but man’s conscious way dey reaction to de given state way dey dis universe. Economics nor fit be about things and things way dem go fit dey touch; na about men, dire meanings and actions. Goods commodities, and wealth and all de other notins way get conduct na not elements of nature; dey na elements of human being meaning and conduct. He who want come deal with dem must not come dey look at de outside world; he must go do search for dem inside de meaning of come dey acting about men.

Praxeology and economics nor go fit deal with de human being meaning and action as dey go fix be or come be if all men go dey inspired by an absolutely valid philosophy and come dey equipped with a perfect sense of technology. For such notions way be as absolute validity and way come get omniscience dere na no room inside de frame of a science whose subject come matter na erring man. An end na everything which men come dey aim at. A means na everything way acting men come dey consider as such.  

Na de task of scientific technology and therapeutics way go come explode de errors inside dire respective fields. Na de task of economics to come dey expose erroneous doctrines inside de field of social action. But if men nor go follow de advice of science, but come dey cling to dire fallacious prejudices, dese errors na reality and must be dealt with as such. Economist come dey consider foreign exchange control as inappropriate to come attain de ends aimed at by dose who come take recourse to it. However, if public opinion nor go fit leave /drop its delusions and government consequently resort to other country exchange control, de course way come dey events na come determined by dis attitude. De kind of  medicine way dey dis days come considers de doctrine of de therapeutic effects of mandrake as a fable. But as e come be say people come get take dis fable as truth, mandrake na economic good and prices before were dey come dey paid for its acquisition. As dem dey deal with price economics nor go fit ask warin things na in de eyes of other people, but only warin dey na in de meaning of dose intent upon getting dem. For e come deals with real prices, come paid and come dey received in real translations, nor be with de price as dey come be if men come be different from warin dey really come be.

Means na necessarily always come get limited, i.e., scarce way come get regard to de services for which man wants to come use dem. If dis no be de case, dere nor if come be any action way come get regard to dem. Where man nor come get restrained bt de insufficient quantity of things way come dem available, dere na nor need for any action. 

Na customary to come call de end ultimate good and de means goods. If you come apply dis terminology economists mainly used to think as technologists and not as praxeologists. Dey come separate between *good way be free* and *economic goods*. Dey come call de free goods dose things which, way come dey available in superfluous yamfu-yamfu, nor need to come be economized. Such goods na, however, not de object of any action. Dey na general conditions of human being welfare; dey na parts of de natural environment inside where man dey live and acts. Only de economic goods na de substratum of action. Dey alone na come deal with in economics. 

Economic goods way dem self na fitted to come dey satisfy human being wants directly and whose serviceableness nor go fit depend on de cooperation of other economic goods, way dem dey  called consumers’ goods or goods way be de first order. Mean way go fit satisfy wants come only dey indirectly when come dey complemented by cooperation of other goods way dem dey called producers’ goods or factors of production or goods of person way be a remoter or higher order. De services way de producers’ goods, come dey bring about, by de cooperation of complementary producers’ goods, a product.  Dis product go fit come be a consumers’ good; e go fit be a producers’ good. E dey possible to come think of de producers’ goods will finally come bring about a consumers’ good. E dey possible to think of de producers’ goods as come arranged dem in orders according to dire proximity to de consumers’ good for whose production dem can be used. Dose producers’ good which dey very near to de place where dem dey produce am for consumers’ good na  ranged inside de second order, and accordingly dose which dey come dey used for de production of goods of de second order inside de third order and so on.  

De reason way dey for such an arrangement of goods in orders na to provide a basis for de theory of value and price of de factors of production. Dem go come shown later how de valuation and de prices of de goods of higher orders na to come depend on de valuation and de prices of de goods way dey lower orders produced by dire expenditure. De first  and ultimate valuation of outside things way come refers only to consumers’ goods 

Na therefore not necessary actually to arrange producers’ goods in different orders from de second to de ::n::th. Na nor less superfluous to come enter into pedantic discussions of whether a good way dey strong like cement way to dey called a good of de lowest order or go come rather be attributed to one of de higher orders. Whether e be raw coffee beans or na roast coffrr beans or na ground coffee or na coffee way dey come prepare for drinking or only coffee dem prepared and come mixed with cream and sugar na to be called a consumers’ good way dey ready for warin people dey come chop na of nor importance. Na warin way be immaterial which kind of talk we come adopt. For warin get regard to de problem of valuation, all dat we come dey talk about a consumers’ good go fit be applied to any good of a higher order (except dose who dey for de highest order) if we come dey consider am as a product.

An economic good nor go fit be necessarily come get embodied in a tangible thing. Nonmaterial economic good dem dey come am services.
