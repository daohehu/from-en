### De Temporal Relations Between Actions

Two tings wey one individual fit do nor fit ever dey synchronous; dia temporal relation na one wey be dat of sooner or later. We fit consider de action of various individual as synchronous only in de light of de physical methods for de measurement of time. Synchronism na praxeological notion only wit regard to de concerted efforts of various men wey dey act.[^5]

One man individual action dey succeed one anoda. Dem nor fit work at de same time; dem only fit follow one anoda for more or less rapid succession. Actions dey wey dey serve several purpose one time. E go dey misleading to refer to dem as one coincidence of various actions.

People dey often fail to recognize de meaning of de term "scale of value" and dem don disregard de obstacles wey dey prevent de assumption of synchronism in de various actions of one individual. Dem don interpret one man various act as de outcome of one scale of value, independent of dis acts and preceding them, and of one devised plan wey dey previous and wey get realization wey dem dey aim at. De scale of value and de plan to which duration and immutability for one certain period of time dey dey attributed, dey hypostatized inside de cause and motive of de various individual action dem. Synchronism wey fit be asserted wit regard to various act don dey easily discovered for de scale of value for plan. But dis ting dey overlook de fact say de scale of value na notin, na just one tool of thought wey dem construct. De scale of value dey manifest eself only for real acting; dem fit discern am only from de observation of real acting. Therefore, e dey impermissible make we contrast am wit real acting and make we use am as yardstick for de appraisal of real action.

E nor dey less impermissible to differentiate between rational and allegedly irrational acting on de basis of one comparison of real acting wit earlier draft and plan for future action dem. E fit dey very interesting sef say yesterday goals don dey set for today acting oda dan de one wey dem really aim for today. But yesterday plan nor dey provide us wit any more objective and nonarbitrary standard for de appraisal of today real acting dan any oda idea and norm.

Dem don attempt to attain de notion of one nonrational action by dis reasoning: If dem prefer :ðŸ…°: to :ðŸ…±: and :ðŸ…±: to ::c::, logically dem suppose prefer :ðŸ…°: to ::c:: be dat. But if actually  dem prefer ::c:: to :ðŸ…°:, we go get one mode of acting wey we nor fit talk say e dey consistent and rational.[^6]

Peson nor suppose confuse de logical concept of consistency (viz., absence of contradiction) and de praxeological concept of consistency (viz., constancy or clinging to de same principles). Logical consistency get e place only for thinkin, constancy get e place only for acting.

Constancy and rationality be entirely different notion. If person valuations  don change,  wey e no dey remit faithfulness to de principles of action wey e espouse once merely for de sake of constancy nor be rational ting, e just dey dey stubborn. Only for one respect na em acting fit be constant: as e dey prefer de more valuable to de less valuable. If de valuation change, acting gat change too. Faithfulness, for under conditions wey don change, for one old plan go dey nonsensical. One logical system gat dey consistent and free of contradiction becos e imply say na de coexistence of all em part and theorem. For acting, wey necessarily dey in de temporal order, nor question of dat kin consistency fit dey. Acting gat dey suited to purpose, and purposefulness require adjustment to changing condition.

Dem consider de presence of mind as one virtue for acting man. Man dey get presence of mind if e get de ability to think and to adjust e acting so quickly wey go be say de interval between de emergence of new condition and de adaptation of e action to dem go become as short as possible. If dem view constancy as faithfulness to one plan once dem don design am  without regard for change in condition, den presence of mind and quick reaction na de very opposite of constancy.

Wen de speculator go stock exchange, he fit draw one definite plan for e operation. Weda or not e cling to dis plan, e action dey rational too in de sense wey dos wey eager to distinguish acting rational from irrational one fit attribute to de term "rational." Dis speculator in de course of de day fit embark upon transactions wey one observer, wey nor take into account de changes occurring in market conditions, nor go fit dey able to interpret am as de outcome of constant behavior. But de speculator dey firm in e intention to make profit and to avoid loss. Accordingly e gat adjust e conduct to de change in market condition and in e own judgment concerning de future development wey price go see.[^8]

Whicheva way wey peson wan twist dis ting, peson nor go ever succeed for formulating de notion of "irrational" action whose "irrationality" nor dey founded upon one arbitrary judgment of value. Make we even suppose, say, peson choose to act inconstantly for no oda purpose dan say for de sake of to dey refute de praxeological assertion say irrational action nor dey. Wetin go happen for ere na say one man dey aim one peculiar goal, viz., de refutation of one praxeological theorem, and say e accordingly dey act differently from wetin e for do otherwise. E don choose one unsuitable means for to dey refute praxeology, na em be dat.

[^5]: To avoid any kin misunderstanding, e go well expedient make we emphasize say dis theorem get nothin to do at all wit Einstein theorem concerning de temporal relation of events wey dey spatially distant.

[^8]: Of course, plans sef fit dey self-contradictory. Sometimes dia contradiction fit be de effect of mistaken judgment. But atimes dat kin contradiction fit dey intentional and serve one definite purpose. For example, if say one publicized program for one government or political party promise high price for de producers and at the same time promise low price for consumers dem, de purpose of dat kin incompatible goals fit dey demagogic. Den de program, de plan wey dey publicized, na self-contradictory one; but de plan of dem authors wey wan make dem attain one definite end thru de endorsement of incompatible aims and dem public announcement nor get any contradiction.
