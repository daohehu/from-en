### Case Probability

Case probability means: We know, wit regard to de particular event, some of de factors wey determine im outcome; but oda determining factors about dey wey we know nothing.

Case probability get nothing in common wit class probability but de incompleteness of our knowledge. For every oda regard de two dey entirely different.

Dere be, of course, plenty instances for wey men try to forecast particular future event on de basis of dia knowledge about de behavior of de class. Doctor fit determine de chances for de full recovery of o, patient if e know say 70 per cent wey dey afflicted wit de same disease recova. If im expresses im judgment correctly, im no go say more dan dat de probability of recovery is ::0.7::, dat is, say out of ten patients not more dan three on de average die. All such predictions about external events, i.e., events for de field of de natural sciences, are of dis character. Dem be in fact no fit forecasts about de issue of de case in question, but statements about de frequency of de various possible outcomes. Dem based either on statistical information or simply on de rough estimate of de frequency derived from nonstatistical experience.

So far as dis types of probable statements dey concerned, we no dey faced wit case probability. In fact we no know anything about de case in question except say e dey instance of a class de behavior of which we know or we think say we know.

A surgeon tells one patient wey considers submitting imself to an operation wey thirty out of every hundred undergoing dis kind operation die. If de patient asks wheda dis number of deaths dey already full, im done misunderstood de sense of de doctor's statement. E done fall prey to de error dem know as de "gambler's fallacy." Like de roulette player wey concludes from a run of ten red for succession say de probability of de next turn being black e dey greater dan e be before de run, e confuses case probability wit class probability.

All medical prognoses, wen dem based only on general physiological knowledge, deal wit class probability. Doctor wey hear say man wey him no know done seized by definite illness, on de basis of im general medical experience, say: Im chances for recovery dey 7 to 3. If de doctor imself treats de patient, e fit get different opinion. De patient na young, vigorous man; im dey good health before dem take am wit de illness. For dis kind case, de doctor fit think, de mortality figures dey lower; de chances for dis patient no dey 7:3, but 9:1. De logical approach remains de same, although e fit no based on a collection of statistical data, but simply on a more or less exact resume of de doctor's own experience wit previous cases. Waitin de doctor know dey always only de behavior of classes. For our instance de class na de class of young, vigorous men dem seized by de illness in question.

Case probability na particular feature of our dealing wit problems of human action. Here any reference to frequency dey inappropriate, as our statements dey always deal wit unique events wey as such--i.e., wit regard to de problem in questionâ€”no be members of any class. We fit form a class "American presidential elections." Dis class concept fit prove useful or even necessary for different kind of reasoning, as, for instance, for de treatment of de matter from de viewpoint of constitutional law. But if we dey deal wit de election of 1944--either, before de election, wit im future outcome or, after de election, wit analysis of de factors wey determined de outcome--we dey grappling wit individual, unique, and nonrepeatable case. De case dey characterized by im unique merits, na class by imself. All de marks wey make e dey permissible to subsume am under any class are irrelevant for de problem in question.

Two football teams, de Blues and de Yellows, go play tomorrow. For de past de Blues done always defeated de Yellows. Dis knowledge no be knowledge about de class of events. If we go consider am as such, we go get to conclude say de Blues dey always victorious and say de Yellows dey always dey defeated. We no go fit dey uncertain wit regard to de outcome of de game. We go know for certain say se Blues go win again. De mere fact say we consider our forecast about tomorrow's game as only probable shows say we no dey argue dis way.

On de oda hand, we believe say de fact say de Blues dey victorious for de past no immaterial wit regard to de outcome of tomorrow's game. We consider am as a favorable prognosis for de repeated success of de Blues. If we go argue correctly according to de reasoning appropriate to class probability, we no go attach any importance to dis fact. If we no go resist de erroneous conclusion of de "gambler's fallacy," we go, on de contrary, argue say tomorrow's game go result for de success of de Yellows.

If we risk some money on de chance of one team's victory, de lawyers go qualify our action as a bet. Dem go call am gambling if class probability dey involved.

Everything wey outside de field of class probability dey commonly implied for de term probability refers to de peculiar mode of reasoning involved for dealing wit historical uniqueness or individuality, de specific understanding of de historical sciences.

Understanding dey always based on incomplete knowledge. We fit believe say we know de motives of de acting men, de ends dem dey aim at, and de means dem plan to apply for de attainment of these ends. We get a definite opinion wit regard to de effects to be expected from de operation of these factors. But dis knowledge dey defective. We no fit exclude beforehand de possibility say we get erred for e appraisal of dia influence or dem failed to take into consideration some factors wey interference we no foresee am at all, or not in a correct way.

Gambling, engineering, and speculating dey three different modes of dealing wit de future.

De gambler know nothing about de event on which de outcome of im gambling depends. All wey im know na de frequency of a favorable outcome of a series of dis kind events, knowledge wey dey useless for im undertaking. He trusts to good luck, say na im only plan.

Life imself dey exposed to plenty risk. At any moment e dey endangered by disastrous accidents wey no fit be controlled, or at least no dey sufficiently. Every man dey bank on good luck. He dey counts upon not being struck by lightning and not bein bitten by viper. An element of gambling for human life. Man fit remove some of de chrematistic consequences of dis kind disasters and accidents by taking out insurance policies. For doing so e bank upon de opposite chances. On de part of de insured de insurance dey gambling. Im premiums dey spent in vain if de disaster no occur.[^2] Wit regard to noncontrollable natural events man dey always for de position of a gambler.

De engineer, on de oda hand, know everything wey dey needed for a technologically satisfactory solution of im problem, de construction of machine. As far as some fringes of uncertainty dey left for im power to control, e try to eliminate dem by taking safety margins. De engineer know de only soluble problems and problems wey no fit be solved under de present state of knowledge. E fit sometimes discover from adverse experience say im knowledge dey less complete dan im done assumed and say im failed to recognize de indeterminateness of some issues wey im think im dey able to control. Den im go try to render im knowledge more complete. Of course im fit neva eliminate altogether de element of gambling present in human life. But na im principle to operate only within an orbit of certainty. E aims at full control of de elements of im action.

E dey customary nowadays to speak of "social engineering." Like planning, dis term na synonym for dictatorship and totalitarian tyranny. De idea na to treat human beings in de same way in which de engineer dey treats de stuff out of which im builds bridges, roads, and machines. De social engineer's will na to be substituted for de will of de various people e plans to use for de construction of im utopia. Mankind na to dey divided into two classes: de almighty dictator, on de one hand, and de underlings wey dem go reduced to de status of mere pawns for im plans and cogs for im machinery, on de other. If dis dey feasible, den of course de social engineer no go need to bother about understanding oda people's actions. Im go be free to deal wit dem as technology deals wit lumber and iron.

For de real world acting man dey faced wit de fact say some fellow men acting on dia own behalf as im imself acts. De necessity to adjust im actions to oda people's actions makes im a speculator for whom success and failure depend on im greater or lesser ability to understand de future. Every action dey speculation. There dey in de course of human events no stability and consequently no safety.

[^2]: For life insurance de insured's stake spent in vain consists only for de difference between de amount collected and de amount he fit get accumulated by saving.
