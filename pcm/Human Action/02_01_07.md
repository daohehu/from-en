### De Great Society

No be every interhuman relation na im be social relation. Wen groups of men rush upon each oda for war of outright extermination, wen men fight against men as mercilessly as dem crush pernicious animals and plants, between de fighting parties, reciprocal effect and mutual relation, but no society. Society na joint action and cooperation in which say people wey participant see de oda partner's success as a means for de attainment of im own.

De struggles for which primitive hordes and tribes fight one anoda for watering places, hunting and fishing grounds, pastures and booty dey pitiless wars of annihilation. Dem dey total wars. So for de nineteenth century dey de first encounters of Europeans wit de aborigines of territories dem newly made accessible. But already for de primeval age, long time ago before de time wey historical records convey information, anoda mode of procedure begin to develop. People wey dem preserve even for warfare some rudiments of social relations dem previously established; for fighting against peoples wit whom dem never before hear any contact, dem begin to take into account de idea wey dey between human beings, notwithstanding dia immediate enmity, later arrangement and cooperation dey possible. Wars dey waged to wound de enemy; but de hostile acts dey no longer merciless and pitiless for de full sense of these terms. De beligerents begin to respect certain limits wey for de struggle against men--as differentiated from dat against beastsâ€”make dem no transcended am. Ontop de implacable hatred and de frenzy of destruction and annihilation a societal element begin to prevail. De idea emerged say every human adversary go dey considered as potential partner for de future cooperation, and say dis fact no go dey neglected for de conduct of military operations. War no dey longer considered de normal state of interhuman relations. People dey recognized say peaceful cooperation na de best means to carry on de struggle for biological survival. We fit even say say as soon as people realized say e dey more advantageous to enslave de defeated dan to kill dem, de warriors, wey still dey fight, give thought to de aftermath, de peace. Enslavement na by and large de preliminary step toward cooperation.

De ascendancy of de idea say even for war no be every act n aim dey considered permissible, say dem go legitimate and illicit acts of warfare, say laws dey, i.e., societal relationships wey dey above all nations, even above those wey dem momentarily dey fight each anoda, done finally established de Great Society embracing all men and all nations. De various regional societies dem merged into one ecumenical society.

Belligerents who no wage war savagely for de manner of beasts, but according to "human" and social rules of warfare, im renounce de use of some methods of destruction in order to collect de same concessions on de part of dia enemy. As far as dis kind rules dey complied wit, social relations dey exist between de fighting parties. De hostile acts themselves dey only asocial, but antisocial. E dey inexpedient to define de term "social relationships" for dis kind way as to include actions wey aim at oda people's annihilation and at de frustration of dia actions.[^8] Na im be de only relations between men and those directed at mutual detriment, neither society nor societal relations dey.

Society no dey merely interaction. Interaction dey--reciprocal influence--between all parts of de universe: between de wolf and de sheep e devours; between de germ and de man e kill; between de falling stone and de thing upon which e falls. Society, on de oda hand, always involves men acting in cooperation wit oda men in order to let all participants attain dia own ends.
