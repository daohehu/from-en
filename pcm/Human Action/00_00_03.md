## Foreword to the 3rd Edition 

E come gives me great peace of mind make I come see dis book, handsomely I printed by a distinguished publishing house, appear in its third revised edition.

Two terminological remarks may come fit be in order. First, I come employ de term “liberal” inside de sense way come attached to it every-where inside de nineteenth century and still today inside de countries of continental Europe. Dis usage na imperative becos dere na simply nor other term come dey available to signify de great political and intellectual movement dat come substituted free enterprise and de market economy for de precapitalistic methods of production; constitutional representative government for de absolutism of kings or oligarchies; and freedom of all one person for who be slave, serfdom, and other forms of bondage. 

Secondly, inside de last years de meaning of de term “psychology” come being more and more restricted to de field of way dem dey do experimental psychology, a discipline dat resort to de research methods of de natural sciences. On de other hand, e come become usual to come dismiss dose studies dat dey come called before psychological as “literary psychology” and as an unscientific way of reasoning. Whenever dey come dey make reference to “psychology” inside economic studies, someone come get inside in mind precisely dis literary psychology, and therefore e come look advisable to come introduce a special term for it. I come dey suggest for my book Theory and History (New Haven, 1957, pp. 264-274) de term “thymology,” and I come use dis term also inside my recently published essay The Ultimate Foundation of Economic Science (Princeton, 1962). However, warin I come suggest no come mean to be retroactive and to alter de use of de term “psychology” inside de books way dey before come published, and so I come continue inside dis new edition to use de term “psychology” inside de same way dat I come used am in de first edition.

Two translations of de first edition of *Human Action* done come out: one Italian person way dey do translation by Mr. Tuilio Bagiotti, who na Professor for de  Universita Bocconi for Milano, under de title *L'Azione Umana, Trattato di economia*, come published am by de Unione Tipografico-Editrice Torinese in 1959; and a person way dey used Spanish-language come do translation by Mr. Joaquin Reig Albiol under de title *La Accion Humana (Tratado de Econo mia)*, way dey come published am in two volumes by Fundacion Ignacio Villalonga in Valencia (Spain) in 1960.

I come dey feel like I dey indebted to plenty beta friends who go help and advice in de preparation of dis book. 

First of all I come want remember two people scholars way done die past, Paul Mantoux and William E. Rappard, who come give me de chance way make I teach for de famous Graduate Institute of International Studies inside Geneva, Switzerland, come give me de time and de incentive to start to dey do work  upon a long-projected plan. 

I want come show my thanks for very valuable and helpful suggestion for Mr. Arthur Goddard, Mr. Percy Greaves, Doctor Henry Hazlitt, Professor Israel M. Kirzner, Mr. Leonard E. Read, Mr. Joaquin Reig Albiot and Doctor George Reisman. 

 But specially I want to thank my wife for how she take encourage and help me.  .
