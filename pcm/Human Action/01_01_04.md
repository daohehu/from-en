### Rationality and Irrationality; Subjectivism and  Objectivity of Praxeological Research

Human action na wetin dey always dey necessarily rational. De term "ration action" come dey pleonastic and dem must reject dat kind thing. If dem apply am to de ultimate ends of action, de term rational and irrational dey inappropriate and meaningless. De ultimate end of action na im always be de satisfaction of some desires of de acting man. Since norbody dey for de position to substitute im own value judgement on top other people aims and volitions. No man dey qualified make e declare wetin go make another man happier abi less discontented. De critic either tell us wetin he believe say im go aim at if to say e dey de position of im fellow; abi, in dictatorial arrogance e blithely dispose de will of im fellow and aspirations, declare de condition of dis other man wey go beta suit imsef, de critic.

E dey usual make dem call action irrational if e aim,  at de expense of ""material" and tangible advantages, at de attainment of "ideal" or "higher" satisfactions. For dis sense people talk say, for instance-- sometimes with approval, sometimes with disapproval-- say man wey sacrifice life, health, abi wealth say e wan attain"higher" goods like fidelity to im religious, philosophical, and politic convictions abi freedom wey dey flower im nation-- dey motivated by irrational considerations. However, de striving wey dey after dese higher end dey neither more abi less rational abi irrational pass dat one after other human ends. Na mistake make dem assume say de desire to procure de bare necessities of life and health dey more rational, natural, abi justified pass de striving after other goods abi amenities. Na true say dey appetite for food and warmth dey common to men and other mammals and say as a rule, man wey lack food and shelter concentrate im effort upon de satisfaction of dese urgent needs and e no care of other things. De impulse to live, to preserve im life, and to take advantage of every opportunity to take strengthen im own vital forces na primal features of life, wey dey present in every living being. However, to yield dis kin of implies for man nor be inevitable necessity.

While all oda animals dey unconditionally driven by de impulse  wey dem go use preserve dia own lives  and by de impulse of proliferation, man get the power wey e go take use master even dese impulses.  E fit control both im sexual desires and im will to live. E fit give up im life when de condition under which e fit preserve am dey intolerable. Man dey capable to die for a course abi of committing suicide. To live for man na de outcome of choice, of a judgement of value.

Na de same with de desire to live inside affluence. De very existence of ascetics and of men wey renounce material gains sake of say dem wan cling to dia conviction and of say dem wan preserve dia dignity and self respect na evidence say striving after more tangible amenities nor dey inevitable but rather na de result of choice. Of course, de immense majority prefer life to death and wealth to poverty.

E dey arbitrary to consider only de satisfaction of de body's physiological needs say e dey "natural"  and therefore "rational" and everything  else dey "artificial" and therefore "irrational". Na de characteristic feature of human nature  be dat say man nor dey seek only food, shelter, and cohabitation like other animals, but say e dey aim at other kinds of satisfaction. Man specifically get human desires and needs wey we fit call "higher" dan de ones wey e get in common with de other mammals[^6].

If dem apply am to de means wey dem been choose for de attainment of ends, de terms rational and irrational imply a judgement about de expediency and how de procedure wey dem employ adequate reach. De critics approve abi dem disapprove of de method from de point of view of whether or not e dey best suited make dem attain de end in question. Na fact say human reason nor dey infallible and say man very often errs if dem wan select abi apply means. An action wey dey unsuited to de end go fall short of expectation. E dey contrary to purpose, but e dey rational, as in, de outcome of a reasonable--although faulty--deliberation and an attempt--although an ineffectual attempt--to attain a definite goal. De doctor wey be say hundred years ago employ certain method take treat cancer wey be say our contemporary doctors reject dey- from de point of view of present-day pathology--badly instructed and therefore inefficient. But dem nor act irrationally; dem do dia  best. E dey probable say  for hundred years mmre doctors go get more efficient  method for dia hand  wey dem go take use treat dis disease. Dem go dey more efficient but dem nor go dey more rational  pass our physicians.

De opposite action nor be irrational behaviour, but na reactive response  to stimuli on de part of bodily organs and instincts wey dem nor fit control by de volition of de person wey e concern. To de same stimulus man fit under certain conditions respond through reactive response and by action. If a man absorb poison, de organs react by setting up dia forces of antidotal defense; for addition, action fit interfere if dem apply counterpoison.

As e regard de problem wey dey inside de antithesis, rational and irrational, nor get difference. Etsern natural sciences and social sciences. Science dey ration and e must always dey rational. Na de endeavur to attain mental grasp of de phenomena of de universe through systematic arrangement of de whole body of knowledge wey dey available. However, as we don point for up, de analysis of objects into dia constituent elements must sooner or later reach a point wey he nor fit pass. De human mind nor dey capable to conceive knowledge wey nor dey limited by ultimate given wey dey inaccessible to further analysis and reduction. De scientific method wey carry de mind up to dis point dey entirely rational. We fit call de ultimate given irrational fact.

Na de new style nowadays make we find fault  with de social  sciences cos dem dey purely  rational. De most popular objection wey dem raise against economics na say e neglect de irrationality of life and reality and e come try to press into dry rational schemes and bloodless abstractions de infinite variety of phenomena. Nor censure dey more absurd. Like every branch of knowledge, economics go far as rational method fit carry am. Den e stop by establishing de face wey e dey faced with an ultimate given, as in, a phenomenon wey we nor fit- at least for de present state of our knowledge- be analyzed further[^7].

De teachings of praxeology and economics dey valid for de action of every human without regard to dia underlying motives, causes, and goals. De ultimate judgements of value and de ultimate ends of de action of human dey given for any kind of scientific inquiry; dem nor dey open to further analysis. Praxeology deal with de ways and means wey chose for de attainment of dat kin ultimate ends. Im object na means, nor be ends.

Na for dis sense we dey yarm tori of de subjectivism of de general science of human action. E take de  ultimate ends wey dem been choose by acting man as data, e dey entirely neutral with regards to dem, and e stop to pass any value  judgements. De only  standard wey e apply na weda or not de means wey dem choose dey fit to carry attain de ends wey dem dey sight. If Eudaemonism talk say na happiness, if Utilitarianism and economics talk say na utility, we must to interpret dese terms for subjectivistic way as de one wey acting man sight cos e dey desirable as im see am. Na for dis formalism na im de progress of de modern meaning of Eudaemonism, Hedonism, and Utilitarianism  consists as e dey opposed to de objectivistic theory of value as expounded by classical political economy. At de same time na for dis objectivity na im our science lies. Cos e dey subjectivistic and e take de value judgement of acting man as ultimate data wey nor dey open to further critical examination, e dey above all strife of parties and factions, e dey indifferent to de conflict of all schools of dogmatism and ethical doctrines, e dey free from valuations and preconceived ideas and judgement, e dey universally valid and absolutely and plainly human.
