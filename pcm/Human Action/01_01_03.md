### Human Action As Wetin Be Ultimate Given

E don tey well well wey man dem  don dey try to sabi de prime mover, de main cause of all being and de cause of change, de main source wey everything dey come from and wetin dey cause am. Science dey more modest. E know say man mind get some kind limits and e know say man dey find knowledge too. E dey try explain dey cause of everything wey get meaning. But e follow know say dis things wey im gats do go surely strike walls wey high pass am. E get things wey nor fit dey explained and e nor fit dey related to anoda thing wey get meaning. Dem dey call dem ultimate given.  de progress of scientific research fit don succeed to show us say something wey we don see as ultimate given fit dey reduced to wetin dey inside am. But somethings go always dey wey we nor fit reduce or explain, something wey be ultimate given. 

Monism dey teach us say na only one ultimate substance na im dey, dualism dey teach us say na two dey, pluralism dey teach us say dem many. E nor even make sense to dey argue about dis kind wahala dem. Dis kind wahala dem na wetin we nor fit stop. Wetin we sabi now nor give us wetin we wan carry solve dis kind wahala wit beta answer wey person go dey satisfied with. 

People wey be Materialist monism dey talk  say wetin man dey think na wetin dey come from organs wey dey inside dia body., de cells wey dey dia brain and de nerves. Wetin man dey think, wetin im wan do and wetin im dey dey come from  material processes wey be say one day dem go use method of physical and chemical inquiry explain am. Dis one sef na wetin dem neva prove but people wey dey support am  believe say na true and na science wey we nor fit talk say na lie

Various doctrines don come up wey go fit explain de relation wey de mind and de body get. Na just wetin dem guess wey nor get beta facts. Wetin we fit just talk be say relation dey between mental and physiological processes. As de nature and operation of dis connection dey, na small thing we sabi, if anytin.

Concrete value judgments and definite human actions nor be wetin we go wan dey explain dey go. We fit just assume say or believe say dem dey depend on wetin dey cause dem. But as far as we nor sabi how facts wey dey external—physical and physiological— dey enta person mind come produce some  kind thoughts wey dem dey carry act, we gats face some kind dualism. As our knowledge dey now, wetin positivism, monism and panphysicalism dey talk na just wetin dem assume and e nor get any ground for science and e nor get meaning and e nor even get use for scientific research. Reason and experience don show us  two different kind places:de external world of physical, chemical, and physiological phenomena and de internal world of thought, feeling, valuation, and action wey get purpose. No bridge fit.connect--as far as say we fit see today- dis two places. External events wey dey de same fit result in different answer wey man go give and external events  wey dey different fit result on de same answer wey man go give. We nor sabi why e be like dat. 

As dis mata be like dis, we go only withhold  our judgement on top wetin monism and materialism dey talk..We fit or we fit nor Believe say natural science go fit explain how some kind ideas carry come out, how we carry dey judge value, and actions de same way wey dem carry explain how dem carry produce chemical compound as dem carry mix elements wey dey necessary. For now, we go dey satisfied wit de method of dualism.

Human action na one of de agencies wey dey bring change. Na element of cosmic activity and becoming. Dis one mean say na legit object wey science dey use do investigion. As--at least as e be now--we nor fit trace wetin dey cause am,  we gats see am as ultimate given and we gats study am like ultimate mata.

Na true say de changes wey human action don bring dey trifling if we compare am wit de effects of  de great cosmic forces operation. if we look am from de view of eternity and de infinite universe, na just very small speck. Apart from man, human action and how e dey carry  change na im be de real thing. Action na im be de essence of im nature and existence, na im be wetin im dey carry preserve im life and na wetin im dey carry high pass animals and plants. but no mata how human efforts fit dey perishable or fit vanish anyhow, e dey important for man and e dey important for human science.
