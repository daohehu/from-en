## Foreword to the 4th Edition

Mises’ contribution way de very easy, yet at de same time come dey extremely profound. He come dey point say de whole economy na de result of warin one person do. One persons come act, choose, cooperate, complete, and come dey buy and sell with one anoder. In dis way Mises come dey explained how difficult e come dey for market phenomena develop. Mises nor come simply describe economic phenomena –prices, wages, interest rates, money, monopoly and even de buying and selling cycle – he come explained dem as de outcomes of warin no dey count conscious, purposive actions, choices, and preferences of one persons, each one of dem who dey try as best as he or she go fit under de situations go fit attain different wants and ends and go fit stop things way nor desired consequence. From today de title Mises come chose for his economic treatise, Human Action. Ehen also, in Mises’ view, Adam Smith’s “invisible hand” come dey explain on de basic of logic and utilitarian principles as de warin go come out of de warin nor get count action of one persons. 

Sprinkled throughout Mises’ scholarly and erudite explanations of market operations come get many colorful descriptions of economic phenomena. For example, warin dey de different between economic and political power: “A ‘chocolate king’ nor come get power to take over de consumers, his patrons. He come give dem chocolate way be de beta quality and come be de cheapest price. He no fit rule de consumers, he come dey serves dem. De consumers … get de right to stop buying from his shops. He go fit lost his ‘kingdom’ if de consumers come prefer to use dire money take buy for elsewhere. “On why people dey buy and sell: “De people way dey live for de Swiss Jura prefer to dey make watches instead of come dey plant wheat. Watchmaking na for dem de cheapest way for dem to get wheat. On de other hand de growing of wheat na e be de  cheapest way for de Canadian farmer to carry get watches. “For Mises warin get price na de ration arrived at on de market by de dose who dey compete for de bids of consumers for money on de one hand and come get some particular good or service on de other. A government go come fit give out decrees, but “A government nor go fit any more come determine de prices than a goose can lay hen’s egg.”

In Mises’ view, de thing way nor dey equality for men na de beginning of getting peaceful interpersonal social cooperation and de source of all de advantages e carry come: “De liberal champions of warin be equal under de law come fully dey aware of de fact dat dey come born all men unequal and dat  na precisely dire inequality dat come  generates social cooperation and civilization. Equality way dey under de law was in dire opinion not designed to correct de inexorable fact of de universe and to come make natural warin nor be equality come disappear. E come dey on de contrary, de device to secure for de whole of mankind de maximum of  warin go benefit am can come out from am…. Equality way de under de law na dire eyes way good becos e go best serves de interests for all. Na de choice of dose who dey vote to choose who dey way make e hold public office and to de consumers to come decide who go direct dire production activities.”

Mises’ 1949 come talk on Social Security and de money way government dey hold come read as if dem had been written yesterday: “Paul in de year 1940 come dey saves by come dey pay one hundred dollars to de national social security institution.  He come receives in exchange a claim which na virtually an unconditional government IOU. If de government come spends de hundred dollars for current expenditures, nor extra capital come enter into existence, and nor thing come increase inside de productivity of labor result. De government’s IOU na a check drawn upon de future taxpayer.  Inside 1970 one peter come have to fulfill warin de government ‘s promise although he by himself nor derive any beta from de fact dat. Paul in 1940 come saved one hundred dollars… De trumpery argument dat de public debt na nor burden becos ‘we dey owe it to ourselves’ na delusive. De Pauls of 1940 know owe am by dem selve. Na de Peters of 1970 who come owe am to de Pauls of 1940… De statesmen of 1940 come solve dire problem by shifting dem to de statesmen of 1970. On de date de statesmen of 1940 will come be either dead or elder statesmen go dey receive glorying in dire wonderful achievement, social security.”

In de “Foreword to de Third Edition” of Human Action Mises come mentioned de Italian and Spanish translations of dis book. Since den dey come translated dem by Tao-Ping Hsia into Chinese (1976/7), by  Raoul Audouin come translate am into French (1985), by Donald Stewart, Jr., come translate am into Portugese (1990), and by Toshio Murata come translate am into Japanese (1991). Its German-language precursor, Nationalokonomie (1940) dem come republished am in (1980).

De person way come publish dis new edition of Human Action done tried to correct de typos dat inevitably creep into almost any book, especially one of dis size. Dey done also included a completely new index, which dey hope will come help make de idea in dis book more to come get readily accessible to dose people who dey read am.
