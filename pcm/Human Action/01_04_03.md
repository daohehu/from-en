### De Scale of Needs

Notwithstandin all declarations to de contrary, de majority of men dey aim, first of all, at de improvement of de material conditions of well-being. Dem wan more and beta food, beta home and clothes, and plenty oda amenities. Dem strive afta abundance and health. If we dey take dis goals as dem dey give us, applied physiology dey try determine wich kin means dey make sense pass to provide satisfaction wey plenty well well. E dey separate, from dis point of view, say between de "real" needs and imaginary and spurious appetites wey man get. E dey teach people how dem suppose dey act and wetin dem suppose target as a means.

De importance of such doctrine dey obvious. From e point of view de physiologist dey right as e distinguish between sensible action and action wey dey contrary to purpose. E dey right as e contrast judicious methods of nourishment from methods wey no wise. E fit no condemn certain modes of behaviour wey dey absurd and opposed to "real" need. Howeva, dat kin judgement dey beside de point for one science wey dey deal wit de reality of human action. Nor be wetin man suppose do, but na wetin e dey do, dey count fro praexology and economics. Hygiene fit dey right or wrong if dem dey call alcohol and nicotine poisons. But economics gat explain de price of tobacco and liquor as dem be, nor be as dem suppose be under anoda condition.

No room again left for de field of economics for scale of needs wey different from de scale of values as man actual behaviour reflect am. Economics dey deal wit real man, even e dey weak and subject to error, but nor be wit ideal beings, wey dey also dey omniscient and perfect as only gods dey be.
