### Numerical Evaluation of Case Probability

Case probability no dey open to any kind of numerical evaluation. Waitin dey commonly considered like dis exhibits, wen more closely scrutinized, a different character.

On de eve of de 1944 presidential election people could have said:

1. I dey ready to bet three dollars against one say Roosevelt go dey elected.
2. I guess say out of de total amount of electors 45 millions go exercise dia franchise, 25 millions of wey go vote for Roosevelt.
3. I estimate Roosevelt's chances as 9 to 1.
4. I dey certain say Roosevelt go dey elected.
 
Statement ::(4):: dey obviously inexact. If dem asked under oath on de witness stand weda im dey certain about Roosevelt's future victory as about de fact say a block of ice go melt wen dem exposed am to temperature of 150 degrees, our man go answered no. im go gat rectified im statement and go get declared: I dey personally fully convinced say Roosevelt go carry on. Na my opinion. But, of course, dis is not certainty, only de way I understand de conditions involved.

De case of statement ::(1):: is similar. Dis man believed say im risked very little wen laying such a wager. De relation 3:1 na de outcome of de interplay of two factors: de opinion say Roosevelt go dey elected and de man's propensity for betting.

Statement ::(2):: na evaluation of de outcome of de impending event. Im figures no refer to greater or smaller degree of probability, but to de expected result of de voting.  statement fit dey based on a systematic investigation like de Gallup poll or simply on estimates.

E dey different wit statement ::(3)::. Dis na proposition about de expected outcome couched for arithmetical terms. E certainly no mean say out of ten cases of de same type nine dey favorable for Roosevelt and one unfavorable. E fit get any reference to class probability. But waiting else e fit mean?

E dey metaphorical expression. Most of de metaphors dem dey use for daily speech imaginatively identify an abstract object wit anoda object wey fit can be apprehended directly by de senses. Yet dis no be necessary feature of metaphorical language, but merely consequence of de fact tsay de concrete na like rule more familiar to us dan de abstract. As metaphors aim de explanation of something wey dey less well known by comparing am wit something better known, dem consist for de most part to identifying something abstract wit better-known concrete. De specific mark of our case na say na attempt to elucidate a complicated state of affairs by resorting to analogy borrowed from de branch of higher mathematics, de calculus of probability. As d happen, dis mathematical discipline dey more popular dan de analysis of de epistemological nature of understanding.

No need to applying de yardstick of logic to critique of metaphorical language. Analogies and metaphors dey always defective and logically unsatisfactory. E dey usual to search for de underlying tertium comparationis. But even dis no be permissible wit regard to de metaphor we dey dealing wit. For de comparison dey based on a conception wey im imself dey faulty for dee very frame of de calculus of probability, namely de gambler's fallacy. For asserting say Roosevelt's chances dey 9:1, de idea na say Roosevelt dey in regard to de impending election for de position of a man wey get 90 per cent of all tickets of de lottery in regard to de first prize. E dey implied say dis ratio 9:1 dey tells us something substantial about de outcome of de unique case for were we get interest. No need to repeat say dis na mistaken idea.

No less impermissible dey de recourse to dee calculus of probability in dealing wit hypotheses in de field of de natural sciences. Hypotheses dey tentative explanations consciously based on logically insufficient arguments. Wit regard to dem all wey fit be asserted na: De hypothesis no or no go contradict either logical principles or de facts as experimentally established and considered as true. For de first case e dey untenable, for de second case e dey--under de present state of our experimental knowledge--not untenable. (De intensity of personal conviction dey purely subjective.) Neither frequency probability nor historical understanding how dem enters into de matter.

De term hypothesis, applied to definite modes of understanding historical events, na misnomer. If a historian asserts say for de fall of de Romanoff dynasty de fact say dis house of German background played important role, im no advance a hypothesis. de facts on which im understanding dey founded beyond question. There was a widespread animosity against Germans for Russia, and de ruling line of de Romanoffs, having for 200 years intermarried exclusively wit scions of families of German descent, dem viewed by plenty Russians as a germanized family, even by those who assumed say Tsar Paul im be de son of Peter III. But de question remains waitin be de relevance of these facts be for de chain of events wey brought about de dethronement of dis dynasty. Dis kind problems no be to open any elucidation oda dan to provided by understanding.
