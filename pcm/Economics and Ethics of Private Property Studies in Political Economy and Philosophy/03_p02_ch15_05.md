### How Dem Restore Morality: On Top Liberation

Na wetin we go do now?, Rothbard nor only reconstruct de ethics of liberty and explain de current morass as de result of statism; im follow show us de way on how we fit carry restore morals. 

First thing be say, im don explain say states as e be like say dem dey very powerful and invincible, say dem owe dia existence to ideas, and since ideas fit change anytime, states fit dey down or dem fit scatter ova nite. 

De representatives of de state dey always dey everywhere and na only small minority of de population wey dem dey rule. de reason for dis dey simple as e dey fundamental: one hundred parasites fit live comfortable lives if dem dey suck out de life blood of thousands of people wey get blood, but thousands of parasites nor fit live comfortably off of a host population wey be just hundred. Yet if government agents na just small minority of the population, how dem go fit enforce dia will on dis population and still dey free? de answer wey Rothbard give as well as de  la Boetie, Hume, and Mises before him na just becos of de voluntary cooperation of de majority of de subject population wit de state. Yet how de state go fit secure dat kind cooperation? de answer na only becos say and so far say de majority of de population believe say de state rule dey legit. Dis one nor mean say de majority gats gree wit every single state measure. Indeed, e fit be say many state policies dey mistaken. But de majority of de population gats believe in de justice of de institution of de state and so dat even if one particular government don do wrong, dis mistakes go just be accident wey must dey accepted and tolerated as dem dey expect beta wey de institution of government go provide. 

Yet how dem go fit bring de majority of de population to believe dis one? na with de help of intellectual people be de answer. For de olden days e mean to try to form alliance with de state and de church. For modern time and as e effective wella, e mean say na through de nationalization (socialization) of education: through state-run or state-subsidized school dem and universities. De market dey ask for people wey get intellectual, for de area of humanities  and social sciences in particular, e nor too high and none dey too stable and secure. Intellectuals dem go dey at de mercy of de value and de choices of de country people, and for general mata de country people nor get interest for intellectualphilosophical concern. De state, for de oda hand, as  Rothbard write, dem dey accommodate dia ego wey don over rise and "dey willing to offer de intellectual people warm, secure and permanent resting place for dia apparatus, income wey secure and de group of prestige". Indeed, de modern democratic state in particular don create massive oversupply of intellectual people.

Dis accommodation  nor guarantee “correct”—statist—thinking, of course; and as well and as dem dey generally overpaid , intellectuals go still dey complain of how little dia oh-so-important work dey appreciated by de powers wey dey. But e dey help to reach de “correct” conclusions if person realize say without de state—the institution of taxation and legislation—person fit dey out of work and fit  come dey try one’s hands at the mechanics of gas pump operation instead of to dey concern himself wit pressing problems like alienation, equity, exploitation, de deconstruction of gender and sex roles, or de culture of the Eskimos, the Hopis, and de Zulus. To add more, even if person dey feel say im dey underappreciated by dis or dat incumbent government, he go still realize say help go fit only come from anoda government, and e nor fit come from an intellectual assault on de legitimacy of de institution of government. So, e nor dey surprising say, as a mata of empirical fact, de overwhelming majority of contemporary intellectuals na far-out lefties and dat even some kind conservative or free market intellectuals like Friedman or Hayek, for example, na fundamentally and philosophically statists.

From dis insight into de importance of ideas and de role of intellectuals as bodyguards of de state and statism, e mean say  de most decisive role wey dey de process of liberation—the restoration of justice and morality—gats fall on de shoulders of wetin person fit call anti-intellectual intellectuals. Yet how dat kind  anti-intellectual intellectuals go fit succeed in delegitimizing de state in public opinion, especially if de overwhelming majority of dia colleagues na statists and dem go do everytin wey dem fit do to isolate and discredit dem as extremists and crackpots? Time go just allow just small short comments ontop dis important  question.

First, person get to reckon wit de vicious opposition from one’s colleagues.  to fit stand am,e dey very important to support de case with ethics and moral arguments, make e nor be economics and utilitarianism, becos na only moral convictions go fit provide person with de courage and strength wey dey needed in ideological battle. Few dey inspired and willing to accept sacrifices if wetin dem dey opposed to  na just small error and waste. More inspiration and courage fit dey drawn from to know say person dey fight evil and lies. ( I go come back to dis mata very soon). 

Second, e dey important to recognize say person nor gats convert im colleagues, dat is, to change dem make dem be mainstream intellectuals. As Thomas Kuhn don show, dis one dey rare enough even in de natural sciences. In de social sciences, conversions among established intellectuals from previously held views na sometin wey we nor dey hear of. Instead, person suppose concentrate  im efforts ontop de young people wey never dey intellectually commited, wey idealism dey make dem also particularly receptive to moral arguments and moral rigorism. Also, person gats try educate de general public dat is de laymen, wey go entertain some kind anti-intellectual prejudices wey person fit tap from easily. 

Third, make I return to de importance of  moral attack on de state, e dey important to know say compromise on the level of theory fit dey. To dey sure, person nor gats  refuse to cooperate wit people wey dey ultimately mistaken and confused, as far as say dia objectives fit dey classified clearly and unambiguously as a step in de right direction of de de-statization of society. For example, person nor go wan refuse cooperation wit people wey wan introduce a flat income tax of 10 percent (although person nor go wan cooperate wit dose wey go wan combine dis measure wit increased sales tax, so dem go fit achieve revenue neutrality, for example). But, make e nor be say dat kind cooperation go lead to or go make compromising person principles come enta. Either taxation na just or e nor dey just. Once e don dey accepted as just, how person go come dey to oppose increase? de answer be say person nor fit!

If we put am differently, compromise on de level of theory as we find am, for example, among moderate free-marketeers like Hayek or Friedman or even among de so-called minarchists,  nor dey only philosophically flawed but e follow dey practically ineffective and indeed counterproductive. dia ideas fit dey–and infact dey co-opted and incorporated by de state rulers and statist ideology. Infact, how many times wey we dey hear from statists dis days and in defense of person wey get statist agenda cries like "even  Hayek (Friedman) says”, or, “not even Hayek (Friedman) denies dat such and such gats dey done by de state”! Personally, dem fit nor dey happy about dis but dem nor fit lie say dia work dey help dis purpose and so dem nor fit tok say dem bin contribute de continued and unabated  growth of state power.

In oda words, theoretical compromise or gradualism go only lead to de  perpetuation of de falsehood, evils, and lies of statism, and only theoretical purism, radicalism, and intransigence go fit and go lead first to gradual practical reform and improvement and den maybe to final victory. Accordingly, as person wey be anti-intellectual intellectual in de Rothbardian sense, person nor fit dey satisfied to dey criticize different kind government palava though person gats start like dis, but person gats continue from dere to a fundamental attack  on de institution of de state as moral outrage and im representative as moral and also economic frauds, liars, and impostors-as emperors wey nor get clothes. 

To dey specific, person no gats think am wen e wan strike at de heart of de legitimacy of de state: wey be de indispensable  role as producer of private protection and security. I don already show how funny dis claim dey if we dey tok theory: how agency wey fit expropriate private property go  dey claim say im be protector of private property? E dey less important to dey attack de legitimacy of de state in dis regard on empirical grounds by to dey point out say states, wey suppose protect us, na dem dey responsible for almost 170million deaths in dis twentieth century alone-wey plenty pass de victims of private crime in de whole human history!And dis numba of victims of private crime, wey government suppose protect us from, suppose dey lower if de governments everywhere and everytime bin nor disarm dia citizen so de government go dey better as effective killing machines.

Instead make we treat politicians wit respect, den our criticism of dem gats dey  increased. Almost to man, dem nor just be thieves dem be mass murderers.  How dem go dey demand our loyalty and respect?

But sharp and distinct ideological radicalization go bring de  results wey we want? I nor get doubt. Infact only radical and radically simple ideas na im fit change de emotions of de dull and indolent masses and delegitimize  government in dia eyes. 

Make I quote Hayek for here (and as I dey do like dis, I  wan show say my harsh criticism of him, mek e nor dey misunderstood say wetin e mean be say person nor fit  learn anytin from  authors wey dey  fundamentally wrong and muddled):

> We must to make de building of free society once more de kind adventure wey dey intellectual, and one deed wey get courage. Wetin we lack na liberal Utopia, a programme wey nor seem like mere defence of tings as dem be and dem nor be diluted kind of socialism too, but truly be liberal radicalism wey nor spare de susceptibilities of de mighty…wey nor too dey severely practical and wey nor confine eself to wetin appear today as politically possible. We need intellectual leaders dem wey dey prepared to resist de blandishments of power and influence and wey dey willing to work for one ideal, howeva small de prospects of em early realization. Dem gat be men wey dey wan stick to principles and to fight for dem full realization, howeva remote. …Free trade and freedom of opportunity be ideas wey still fit raise de imaginations of large numbers, but one mere “reasonable freedom of trade” or one mere “relaxation of controls” nor dey intellectually respectable and e nor dey likely to inspire any enthusiasm….
>
> Unless say we fit make de philosophic foundations of a free society make e be  living intellectual issue, and im implementation a task wey go challenge de ingenuity and imagination of our liveliest minds, de prospects of freedom dey very dark. But if we fit regain dat belief in de power of ideas wey bin be de Mark of liberalism, de battle nor dey  lost.

Hayek bin nor follow im own advice and im nor provide us theory wey dey consistent and inspiring. im Utopia, wey bin de Constitution of liberty, na im be de uninspiring vision of de Swedish welfare state. Instead na Rothbard wey don do wetin Hayek bin see say dey important for renewal of a classical liberalism; and if anytin dey wey fit reverse de tide of statism wey be like say e nor fit stop and restore justice and liberty, na de personal example wey Murray Rothbard don set and how Rothbardism don spread.
