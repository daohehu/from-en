E no hard to show sey this conclusion them legit, if we consider the case of tax money wey everybody know. Such assets are only acquired and held because they can purchase other valuable assets at future dates. They have no own intrinsic use-value at all (as in the case of a fiat paper money), or such use-value is insignificant compared to the exchange-value (as in the case of the gold standard where money also has an—albeit small—commodity value). Rather, the value attached to them is due to their future purchasing power. Yet if the value of money consists of representing other future available assets, the effects of taxing money becomes clear immediately. Most importantly, along with increasing the marginal utility of leisure or consumption, such a tax increases the marginal utility of such future assets. This change in the constellation of incentives translates itself for an actor into increased attempts to obtain these assets more quickly, in less time-consuming production processes. The only production processes now that are systematically shorter than those of attaining future assets indirectly, via the earlier acquisition of money, are those of acquiring them through direct exchanges. Thus, taxation implies that barter trade will be substituted increasingly for the lengthier roundabout production method of monetary exchanges. But once again, resorting increasingly to barter is a regression to economic primitivism and barbarism. It was precisely because production for bartering purposes yielded an extremely low output that mankind actually outgrew this developmental stage and instead increasingly resorted to and expanded a system of production-forindirect-exchange purposes which, while requiring a longer waiting period, renders a far larger return of ever more and different assets drawn into the cash nexus. Every act of taxation means a coerced step backward in this process. It reduces output, decreases the extent of the division of labor, and leads to a reduction in social and economic integration (which, it may be noted, could never have become worldwide, were it not for the institution of indirect monetary exchanges).

Furthermore, the general tendency towards increasingly adopting direct instead of indirect exchange mechanisms caused by every coercive seizure of money also has highly important consequences with regard to the methods of attaining money itself. Just as in the case of non-monetary assets, the increased marginal utility of money along with that of leisure-consumption also makes it relatively more attractive to acquire money in less time-consuming ways. Instead of acquiring it in return for value-productive efforts, i.e., within the framework of mutually beneficial exchanges, taxation raises the incentive to acquire it more quickly and directly, without having to go through such tediously roundabout methods as producing and contracting. On the one hand, this means that one will try more frequently to increase one’s money assets by simply hiding them from the tax collector. On the other hand, a growing tendency will emerge to come into the possession of money through coercive seizure—either in the illegal form called stealing, or legally, by participating in the game called politics.[^9]

Having completed this general economic analysis of the effects of taxation, which today’s economic textbook writers typically prefer not to deal with at all, let me now turn to what they typically do say about the effects of taxation under the heading of tax-incidence. In light of our previous analysis it will be easy to detect the fatal flaw in such accounts. Indeed, that one should fall headlong into error in dealing with specifics if one has not bothered to study the basics can hardly come as a complete surprise.

The standard account of the problem of tax-incidence most frequently exemplified by the case of an excise or sales tax goes like this:[^10] Suppose an excise or sales tax is imposed. Who must bear the burden of this? It is recognized—and I have of course no intention of disputing the validity of this—that in one sense there can be no question that consumers must take the brunt, and invariably do. For no matter what the specific consequences of such a tax are, it must either be the case that consumers will have to pay a higher price for the same goods and their standard of living will be impaired because of this, or it must be the case that the tax imposes higher costs on producers, and consumers will then be punished because of a lower output produced. However, and it is with this that we will have to disagree sharply, it is then argued that whether or not the imposition of a tax harms consumers in the former or in the latter way is an open empirical question, the answer to which depends on the elasticity of demand for the taxed products. If the demand is sufficiently inelastic, then producers will shift the entire burden onto consumers in the form of higher prices. If it is highly elastic, then producers will have to absorb the tax in the form of higher costs of production, and if some section of the demand curve is inelastic and another elastic (this allegedly being empirically the most frequent case), then the burden somehow will have to be shared, with part of it being shifted onto consumers and another falling on producers.

What is wrong with this sort of argument? While it is couched in terms different from those used in my earlier analysis, one can hardly fail to notice that it merely restates, on a somewhat more specific level of discussion, what has already been demonstrated as false on a more general level: the thesis that taxes may or may not reduce productive output; that there is no necessary connection between taxes and productive output; and that it must be considered empirically possible that a tax may affect consumption exclusively while production remains untouched. To assume, as the textbook-account of taxincidence does, that taxes can be shifted forward, either totally or partially, onto consumers is simply to say that a tax may not negatively affect production. For if it were possible to shift any amount of a tax forward onto consumers, that amount would represent a “nonproduction tax”, a tax exclusively on consumption.[^11]

In order to refute the typical textbook analysis, one could simply go back to our previous discussion that resulted in the conclusion that any tax imposed on people constrained by time preference must negatively affect production above and beyond any negative consequences that it implies for consumption. However, I will choose a somewhat different route of argument here in order to make essentially the same point and thereby establish the more specific thesis that no amount of any tax can be shifted onto consumers. To assume otherwise is to assume something manifestly impossible.

De one wey tax-forward-shifting doctrine go come tey dey absurd go com dey clear as soon as person go try make e apply am for where only one person dey act wetin two people go act – producer own and consumer own. For dat kain producer-consumer, na de doctrine come make us dey talk like dis: if he con see say de price wey e go tey buy some kain future goods increase-as increase wey im be, say imself com dey perceive am as event wey go increase cost-den e go com shift all dis cost wey high give imself for de kain way wey e go com put value wey still high for de goods wey dem wan buy, den e go com fall back to profit-margin wey don old, den e go com leave dat e producer role as role wey nor go change and wey nor go spoil, and e go com require some kain small small adjustments for only dat e consumer role. Or if dem com form am make e com bad well well, as far as all dose e effort wey dey produce value dey concerned, tax nor go com make any difference for to dat person, because he just start to dey like all dose goods wey dem wan produce well well.

If we dey reason am plainly, e go come show say wetin dey really dey bring all dose kain absurdity na confusion wey start from de beginning wey dey very important: De doctrine wey be forward-shifting go con come out if we nor recognize say for person analysis, person sopoz assume say dem don already give demand-and dem go must assume am because say dem fit give am anytime. Any analysis wey nor carry dis thing don already spoil, because if we assume say dem change demand, den everything go com dey possible: production go fit increase or e go come reduce or e fit nor even change at all. If I dey produce tea, and dem put tax on top tea, and if dem assume am say de way wey dem tey dey demand tea always dey rise, den na normal thing wey be say people nor mind if dem pay wetin big pass wetin dem first dey pay before. And dis on no even be shifting of tax but na wetin dey happen if dem change de way wey dem tey dey demand. If we wan carry dis possibility put under de heading wey concern tax-incidence analysis na just nonsense: na even analysis wey concern question wey dey entirely different wey dey concern how prices tey dey affect how demand tey dey change and wey nor get anything to do with de effect wey taxation dey cause. De confusion wey dey here e big well well like wetin person go see if e “reject” de statement wey talk say one apple and anoda one com make two if e talk say “No, I just add anoda apple and see, no be two apples dey here but na three dey here.” E dey hard to get away with dat kind nonsense for maths; for economics, doctrine we nor too dey absurd na de orthodoxy.

Yet if person dey committed logically to dey assume say dem give demand anytime wey person dey try to answer de question weda dem fit shift tax go front or dem nor fit shift am, dem sopoz interpret all de tax as events wey just dey affect only de side wey dey supply: e dey reduce de supply for de one wey go affect suppliers.[^12] Any oda thing wey we conclude go com result to denial of wetin we don dey assume from de beginning-say dem don really put tax on top producers as dem dey perceive am. If we wan talk am say de supply curve dey always dey shift anytime we remove tax (while de demand curve go still remain de same just as e tey be before) na to talk say e nor get any oda thing other dan say de entire tax-burden say na only de suppliers go dey carry am. If we wan dey sure, de one wey e dey shift go left for de supply curve e go cause make price go up and na customers go com suffer am if dem com dey  pay big big money on top all dese things and dem com only fit buy small things with dat money.[^13] So all dose customers go come dey hurt by all dose taxes wey dem put on top and dem never doubt am if we think am. However, na wrong thing if we dey think am say dose prices wey dey high na say we dey shift tax load comot from producers give consumers. Instead all dose consumers dey feel am “only” because of all dose harm wey producers dey cause, even with de prices wey dey high for wetin dem dey supply, dem go must bear de load.[^14] Person sopoz ask imself why, if entrepreneur com really shift any amount of tax-burden comot from imself put for consumers body, e for nor do so if e voluntarily put tax on top e own self, instead of make e dey wait for the tax wey dem dey use force put make e come! De answer dey clear: Every time, e dey constrained for de activity wey concern price-setting by de demand wey dem give. De price wey entrepreneur set, e set am with de mind say price go dey higher dan de one wey dem don first choose go come result to total revenue wey go dey low. Otherwise, if e dey expect say price wey dey high go bring revenue wey dey high, him for increase am. As far as  say entrepreneur dey expect say de demand go dey inelastic within de price range wey we dey consider, e go take advantage of dis thing and e go com choose price wey dey high. He go com stop to dey increase de price and he go com settle for only one because wetin e dey expect  com dey reversed and he go come dey hope say de demand curve wey dey above dis price go dey elastic. Dese tinz wey we dey expect wey concern de elastic and non elastic portions for de demand curve, nor be all of them dem dey change if de entrepreneur dey face tax.Den as e com dey expect say all dose prices wey don high go con cause make revenue loss. Derefor, e nor even join de question if we dey argue say he go fit escape de burden wey tax dey bring. In fact, if because of say as dem reduce supply, prices con go up, dis movement wey com go up must to enter de part wey dey elastic for de demand curve and na de entrepreneur go come pay de full money for de way wey be say na de revenue go reduce. Any other thing wey we con conclude nor go com dey correct logically Only if de entrepreneur dey expect say de way wey demand tey dey change go com dey occur side by side with taxation if change e price wey e be say loss nor go dey. If he con dey expect say make demand increase, for instance, like e go com be say na inelastic stretch go com dey instead of elastic stretch for de demand curve wey pass de price wey somtin tey dey go up, he go con fit raise am without say e nor punish anybody. Again, dis one nor be say dem dey shift tax go front. Dis one na demand wey con go up. Even though say tax dey or e nor dey, de entrepreneur for still do de same thing. De tax nor get anything to do with all dose price wey dey change. For any case sha, na de suppliers of all dose goods wey dem dey pay tax put sopoz pay de tax exclusively and e go pay am in full.[^15]

[^9]: For here again,wetin dem don already explain wey dey somehow different from wetin we talk for note 7 wey dey up go com dey clear: why e be very important mistake if we think say taxation fit get effect wey dey “neutral” on top production as in any effect wey dey “negative” on top people wey dey *pay* tax dem go fit compensate dem if dem correspond with effects wey dey “positive” on top people wey dey *spend* tax. Wetin dem dey overlook for all dis kain reasoning na say de introduction of taxation nor dey only imply say e dey favor people wey no dey produce at de expense of people wey dey produce. E just dey change, for people wey dey produce and people wey nor dey produce alike, de cost wey dem attach to different methods wey dem take dey get income, because e nor go com dey too costly to get additional income through means wey nor dey productive, na im be say no be through de way to dey produce more goods but to dey participate for de process wey dem take dey acquire goods wey dem don already produce wey nor dey contract. If dem apply dat kain incentive for one kain population too, den de length wey concern production structure go com short more more, and e go com lead to make output of goods wey dem dey produce com reduce.

[^12]: Baumol and Blinder, *Economics: Principles and Policy*, p. 636, com show say de *demand* curve dey change if e dey respond to tax.

[^13]: If we wan avoid any misunderstanding den: as far as say de textbook don analyze tax-incidencce, com show us dis fact wey of course dey very correct. Na de interpretation of wetin dey happen wey dem give wey dey confuse fundamentally!

[^14]: Look dis point too Rothbard, *Man, Economy, and State*, p. 809.

[^15]: Make tax nor affect supply at all from de beginning, as na wetin go happen later, den e follow de analysis wey dem give for up say de price wey dem dey charge nor go change at all. Because if dem raise am say dem dey respond to de tax go com imply say dem dey push am inside de elastic region wey dey de demand curve again. Later, de supply go com reduce and de prices must to enter dis region, forward shifting nor go com take place.
