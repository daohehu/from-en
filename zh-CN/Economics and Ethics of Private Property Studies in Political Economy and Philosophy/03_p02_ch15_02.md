### 解决办法：原始占有和私有财产的概念

在社会和政治思想史上，有许多提议被提出，据称是解决社会秩序问题的办法，而这种各种互相矛盾的提案促成了这样一个事实，即今天一直在寻求单一的“正确”解决方案虚幻。这种互相矛盾的建议也促成了这样一个事实，即今天寻找一个“正确”的解决办法常常被视为虚幻。然而，正如我将要证明的，一个正确的解决方案是存在的，因此，没有理由屈服于道德相对主义。我没有发现这个解决方案，Murray Rothbard也没有发现这个问题。相反，如果不是更长的时间，这个解决方案已经有数百年的历史了。Murray Rothbard 的成名是“仅仅”，他重新发现了这个旧的和简单的解决方案，并且比之前的任何人都更清楚，更有说服力地阐明了它。

首先，我先为伊甸园所代表的特殊情况制定解决方案，然后以“全方位稀缺”的“真实世界”为代表的一般情况，然后解释为什么这个解决办法，而没有其他解决办法是正确的。

在伊甸园，解决办法是提供一条简单的规则，规定每个人都可以随意放置或移动自己的身体，只要没有其他人已经站在那里，占据相同的空间。对伊甸花园的外面，在全面短缺的领域，解决的办法是用该规则规定：每个人都是自己身体的真正所有者以及所有的地方，自然在他占有并使用自己的身体意味着商品，只要没有其他人已经占领了或用相同的地方和货物在他面前。这种所有权的“原已“场所和货物的人意味着他将在他认为合适的任何方式，这些地方的商品变换的权利，只要他不会不情愿地改变原先由另一个人。特别是，一旦某个地方或商品被 John Locke 的短语“混合自己的劳动力”首先占用，这些地方和商品的所有权只能通过自愿将合同转让其财产所有权的方式获得之前的所有者。

鉴于普遍存在的道德相对主义，值得指出的是，这种原始挪用和私有财产作为解决社会秩序问题的观念完全符合我们的道德直觉。宣称一个人不应该是自己身体的正当拥有者以及他最初，即在任何其他人之前通过他的身体占有，使用和/或生产的地方和物品，这不是荒谬的吗？如果不是他，还有谁应该成为他们的主人？包括儿童和原始人在内的绝大多数人是否也按照这些规则行事并不是显而易见的，而且毫无疑问地并且是理所当然的事吗？ 

尽管道德直觉很重要，但它不是一个证明。然而，确实有证据证明我们的道德直觉是正确的。

证据可以以双重方式提供。另一方面，这样的证明可以提供拼写出来的后果，如果有人否认原拨款制度的有效性和私有财产：如果一个人 ::A::不是自己身体的主人和场所和货物原已和/或产生与身体以及货物自愿（合同）从另一个以前的所有者获得，然后只存在两个备选方案。另一个人 ::B::必须承认为::A::的身体，以及所指、生产或取得的场所和货物::A::或所有人, ::A:: 和 ::B::必须被认为是所有物体、场所和货物的平等拥有者。

In the first case, ::A:: would be reduced to the rank of ::B::’s slave and object of exploitation. ::B:: is the owner of ::A::’s body and all places and goods appropriated, produced, and acquired by ::A::, but ::A:: in turn is not the owner of ::B::’s body and the places and goods appropriated, produced and acquired by ::B::. Hence, under this ruling two categorically distinct classes of persons are created—*Untermenschen* such as ::A:: and *Übermenschen* such as ::B::—to whom different “laws” apply. Accordingly, such a ruling must be discarded as a human ethic equally applicable to everyone *qua* human being (rational animal). From the very outset, any such ruling can be recognized as not universally acceptable and thus cannot claim to represent law. For a rule to aspire to the rank of a law—a *just* rule—it is necessary that such a rule apply equally and universally to everyone.

或者，在普遍平等的共有第二种情况下，人人平等的法律要求得到满足。然而，这种选择又遭受另一个更严重的缺陷，因为如果它被应用，人类将立即灭亡。（因为每个人的道德必须允许人类的生存，这种替代必须拒绝。） Every action of a person requires the use of some scarce means (at least the person’s body and its standing room), but if all goods were co-owned by everyone, then no one, at no time and no place, would be allowed to do anything unless he had previously secured every other co-owner’s consent to do so. However, how could anyone grant such consent if he were not the exclusive owner of his own body (including his vocal cords) by means of which his consent must be expressed? Indeed, he would first need others’ consent in order to be allowed to express his own, but these others cannot give their consent without having first his, etc.

This insight into the praxeological impossibility of “universal communism”, as Rothbard referred to this proposal, brings us immediately to an alternative way of demonstrating the idea of original appropriation and private property as the only correct solution to the problem of social order. Whether or not persons have any rights and, if so, which ones, can only be decided in the course of argumentation (propositional exchange). Justification—proof, conjecture, refutation—is *argumentative* justification. Anyone who denied this proposition would become involved in a performative contradiction because his denial would itself constitute an argument. Even an ethical relativist must accept this first proposition, which has been referred to as the *a priori of argumentation*.

From the undeniable acceptance—the axiomatic status—of this a priori of argumentation, two equally necessary conclusions follow. First, it follows under what circumstances *no* rational solution to the problem of conflict arising from scarcity exists. Suppose in my earlier scenario of Crusoe and Friday that Friday was not the name of a man but of a gorilla. Obviously, just as Crusoe can run into conflict regarding his body and its standing room with Friday the man, so he might do so with Friday the gorilla. The gorilla might want to occupy the same space that Crusoe occupies. In this case, at least if the gorilla is the sort of entity that we know gorillas to be, there is in fact no rational solution to their conflict. Either the gorilla wins, and devours, crushes, or pushes Crusoe aside (that is the gorilla’s solution to the problem) or Crusoe wins, and kills, beats, chases away, or tames the gorilla (that is Crusoe’s solution). In this situation, one may indeed speak of moral relativism. One may concur with Alasdair MacIntyre, a prominent philosopher of the relativist persuasion, who asks as the title of one of his books, *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?*—Crusoe’s or the gorilla’s? Depending on whose side one chooses, the answer will be different. However, it is more appropriate to refer to this situation as one in which the question of justice and rationality simply does not arise: as an extra-moral situation. The existence of Friday the gorilla poses for Crusoe merely a technical problem, not a moral one. Crusoe has no other choice but to learn how to manage and control the movements of the gorilla successfully just as he must learn to manage and control the inanimate objects of his environment.

By implication, only if both parties to a conflict are capable of engaging in argumentation with one another can one speak of a moral problem and is the question of whether or not there exists a solution meaningful. Only if Friday, regardless of his physical appearance (i.e., whether he looks like a man or like a gorilla), is capable of argumentation (even if he has shown himself to be so capable only once), can he be deemed rational and does the question whether or not a correct solution to the problem of social order exists make sense. No one can be expected to give an answer to someone who has never raised a question or, more to the point, to someone who has never stated his own relativistic viewpoint in the form of an argument. In that case, this “other” cannot but be regarded and treated like an animal or plant, i.e., as an extra-moral entity. Only if this other entity can in principle pause in his activity, whatever it might be, step back so to speak, and say “yes” or “no” to something one has said, do we owe this entity an answer and, accordingly, can we possibly claim that our answer is the correct one for both parties involved in a conflict.

Second, it follows from the a priori of argumentation that everything that must be presupposed in the course of an argumentation—as the logical and praxeological precondition of argumentation—cannot in turn be argumentatively disputed as regards its validity without one becoming thereby entangled in an internal (performative) contradiction. Propositional exchanges are not made up of free-floating propositions but constitute a specific human activity. Argumentation between Crusoe and Friday requires that both possess, and mutually recognize each other as possessing, exclusive control over their respective bodies (their brain, vocal cords, etc.) as well as the standing room occupied by their bodies. No one could propose anything and expect the other party to convince himself of the validity of this proposition or else deny it and propose something else unless his and his opponent’s right to exclusive control over their respective bodies and standing rooms were already presupposed and assumed to be valid. In fact, it is precisely this mutual recognition of the proponent’s as well as the opponent’s property in his own body and standing room which constitutes the *characteristicum specificum* of all propositional disputes: that while one may not agree regarding the validity of some specific proposition one can agree nonetheless on the fact that one disagrees.

Moreover, this right to property in one’s own body and its standing room must be considered a priori (or indisputably) justified by proponent and opponent alike. Anyone who wanted to claim any proposition as valid vis-à-vis an opponent would already have to presuppose his and his opponent’s exclusive control over their respective body and standing room simply in order to say “I claim such and such to be true, and I challenge you to prove me wrong”.[^1]

[^1]: So much for John Rawls’s claim, in his celebrated *Theory of Justice*, that we cannot but “acknowledge as the first principle of justice one requiring an equal distribution (of all resources)”, and his comment that “this principle is so obvious that we would expect it to occur to anyone immediately”. What I have demonstrated here is that any egalitarian ethic such as this proposed by Rawls is not only *not* obvious but must be regarded instead as absurd, i.e., as self-contradictory nonsense. If Rawls were right and all resources were indeed equally distributed, then he literally would have no leg to stand on and support him in proposing the very nonsense that he does pronounce.

Furthermore, it would be equally impossible to engage in argumentation and rely on the propositional force of one’s arguments if one were not allowed to own (exclusively control) other scarce means (besides one’s body and its standing room). If one did not have such a right, then we would all immediately perish and the problem of justifying rules simply would not exist. Hence, by virtue of the fact of being alive property rights to other things must be presupposed as valid, too. No one who is alive could possibly argue otherwise.

And if a person were not permitted to acquire property in these goods and spaces by means of an act of original appropriation, i.e., by establishing an objective (intersubjectively ascertainable) link between himself and a particular good and/or space prior to anyone else, but if instead property in such goods or spaces were granted to late-comers, then no one would be permitted to ever begin using any good unless he had previously secured such late-comers’ consent. Yet how can a late-comer consent to the actions of an early-comer? Moreover, every late-comer would in turn need the consent of other still later-comers, and so on. That is, neither we, nor our forefathers, nor our progeny would have been or will be able to survive if one were to follow this rule. However, in order for any person—past, present, or future—to argue anything it must be possible to survive then and now, and in order to do just this property rights cannot be conceived of as being timeless and unspecific with respect to the number of persons concerned.

Rather, property rights must necessarily be conceived of as originating as a result of definite individuals acting at definite points in time and space. Otherwise, it would be impossible for anyone to ever say anything at a definite point in time and space and for someone else to be able to reply. Simply saying that the first-user-first-owner rule of the ethics of private property can be ignored or is unjustified implies a performative contradiction, for one’s being able to say so must presuppose one’s existence as an independent decision-making unit at a given point in time and space.
